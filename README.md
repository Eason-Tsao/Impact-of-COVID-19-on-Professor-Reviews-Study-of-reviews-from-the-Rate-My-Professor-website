## Abstract
This paper goes over the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning by
analyzing text student review data on the Rate My Professors website. Specifically, this analysis
examines whether review sentiment was more negative during the pandemic, the correlation
between review sentiment and grade/quality/difficulty, and if pandemic sentiment decreased
differently by department (engineering/computer science < business/economics < theater).
Utilizing, word clouds, sentiment analysis, T-test, semantic analysis, and LDA topic modeling
we saw COVID-19 did not cause a statistically significant change in review sentiment, there was
a positive correlation between sentiment and grade/quality and a negative correlation with
difficulty, and department was a confounding variable in pandemic sentiment. Specifically, the
business department had the greatest drop in sentiment, followed by engineering and computer
science, with a slight drop in economics, and an increase in theater professor review sentiment
all because of the pandemic. From this analysis, it is recommended that professors focus on
balancing coursework with interactiveness, cater learning styles to the specific department, and
regularly monitor student sentiment for continuous improvement.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted many young adults, especially students and
professors who had to change their learning and teaching styles. This shift led to ancillary effects
on how students learn today. While studies indicate that 51% of college students can’t
concentrate as well as before COVID-19, there is more to understand concerning post-pandemic
student learning (National Survey of Student Engagement, 2021).

Looking at student testimonies on professors’ performance during the pandemic
compared to outside the pandemic can give far greater insight into how student learning has
evolved. This can be evaluated by looking at the website ratemyprofessor.com (RMP). Rate My
Professor is a professor review site where any student can anonymously leave a review for a
professor. By analyzing professor reviews from students during and outside the pandemic, there
can be more honest and quantitative insights into the pandemic’s effects on student learning.
